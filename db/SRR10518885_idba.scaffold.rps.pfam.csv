A sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis showed that the GRAS family emerged in bacteria and belongs to the Rossmann-fold, AdoMET (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase superfamily. All bacterial, and a subset of plant GRAS proteins, are predicted to be active and function as small-molecule methylases. Several plant GRAS proteins lack one or more AdoMet (SAM)-binding residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues.

Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure."

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

It adopts a beta barrel, modified PUA-like, fold that is widely present in eukaryotic chromatin proteins and in bacteria. Versions of this domain are known to bind hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotides and also other 5mC containing dinucleotides. The domain binds DNA by flipping out the methylated cytosine base from the DNA double helix.The conserved tyrosine and aspartate residues and a glycine rich patch are critical for recognition of the flipped out base. Mammalian UHRF1 that contains this domain plays an important role in maintenance of methylation at CpG dinucleotides by recruiting DNMT1 to hemimethylated sites associated with replication forks. The SAD/SRA domain has been combined with other domains involved in the ubiquitin pathway on multiple occasions and such proteins link recognition of DNA methylation to chromatin-protein ubiquitination. The domain is also found in species that lack DNA methylation, such as certain apicomplexans, suggestive of other DNA-binding modes or functions. A highly derived and distinct version of the domain is also found in fungi where it is fused to AlkB-type 2OGFeDO domains. In bacteria, the domain is usually fused or associated with restriction endonucleases, many of which target methylated or hemi-methylated DNA."

A subset of SET domains have been called PR domains. These domains are divergent in sequence from other SET domains, but also appear to mediate protein-protein interaction. The SET domain consists of two regions known as SET-N and SET-C. SET-C forms an unusual and conserved knot-like structure of probably functional importance.

This 180 residue long domain is found at the amino terminus of a variety of proteins. In the yeast protein SYG1, the N-terminus directly binds to the G-protein beta subunit and inhibits transduction of the mating pheromone signal. Similarly, the N-terminus of the human XPR1 protein binds directly to the beta subunit of the G-protein heterotrimer leading to increased production of cAMP. These findings suggest that all the members of this family are involved in G-protein associated signal transduction. The N-termini of several proteins involved in the regulation of phosphate transport, including the putative phosphate level sensors PHO81 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and NUC-2 from Neurospora crassa, are also members of this family. The SPX domain of S. cerevisiae low-affinity phosphate transporters Pho87 and Pho90 auto-regulates uptake and prevents efflux. This SPX dependent inhibition is mediated by the physical interaction with Spl2 NUC-2 contains several ankyrin repeats pfam00023. Several members of this family are annotated as XPR1 proteins: the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor confers susceptibility to infection with murine xenotropic and polytropic leukaemia viruses (MLV). Infection by these retroviruses can inhibit XPR1-mediated cAMP signalling and result in cell toxicity and death. The similarity between SYG1, phosphate regulators and XPR1 sequences has been previously noted, as has the additional similarity to several predicted proteins, of unknown function, from Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and many other diverse organisms. In addition, given the similarities between XPR1 and SYG1 and phosphate regulatory proteins, it has been proposed that XPR1 might be involved in G-protein associated signal transduction and may itself function as a phosphate sensor."

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen.

In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

Since the numbering of different OATPs in particular species was based originally on the order of discovery, similarly numbered OATPs in humans and rats did not necessarily correspond in function, tissue distribution and substrate specificity (in spite of the name, some OATPs also transport organic cations and neutral molecules). Thus, Tamai et al. initiated the current scheme of using digits for rat OATPs and letters for human ones. Prostaglandin transporter (PGT) proteins are also considered to be OATP family members. In addition, the methotrexate transporter OATK is closely related to OATPs. This family also includes several predicted proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.

The N-terminal domain contains the pfam00004 domain. In zebrafish, the liebeskummer (lik) mutation, causes development of hyperplastic embryonic hearts. lik encodes Reptin, a component of a DNA-stimulated ATPase complex. Beta-catenin and Pontin, a DNA-stimulated ATPase that is often part of complexes with Reptin, are in the same genetic pathways. The Reptin/Pontin ratio serves to regulate heart growth during development, at least in part via the beta-catenin pathway. TBP-interacting protein 49 (TIP49) was originally identified as a TBP-binding protein, and two related proteins are encoded by individual genes, tip49a and b. Although the function of this gene family has not been elucidated, they are supposed to play a critical role in nuclear events because they interact with various kinds of nuclear factors and have DNA helicase activities.TIP49a has been suggested to act as an autoantigen in some patients with autoimmune diseases."

The Reptin/Pontin ratio serves to regulate heart growth during development, at least in part via the beta-catenin pathway.

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.

PPR_long is the region of Arabidopsis protein-only RNase P (PRORP) enzyme that consists of up to eleven alpha-helices. PRORPs are a class of RNA processing enzymes that catalyze maturation of the 5' end of precursor tRNAs in Eukaryotes. All PPR proteins contain tandemly repeated sequence motifs (the PPR motifs) which can vary in number. The series of helix-turn-helix motifs formed by PPR motifs throughout the protein produces a superheros with a central groove that allows the protein to bind RNA. Proteins containing PPR motifs are known to have roles in transcription, RNA processing, splicing, stability, editing, and translation. Over a decade after the discovery of PPR proteins, the super-helical structure was confirmed. The protein-only mitochondrial RNase P crystal structure from Arabidopsis thaliana (PRORP1) confirmed the role of its PPR motifs in pre-tRNA binding and suggest it has evolved independently from other RNase P proteins that rely on catalytic RNA."

Thus wild-type Mlo proteins are thought to be inhibitors of cell death whose deficiency lowers the threshold required to trigger the cascade of events that result in plant cell death. Mlo proteins are localized in the plasma membrane and possess seven transmembrane regions; thus the Mlo family is the only major higher plant family to possess 7 transmembrane domains.

Its diverse architectures in eukaryotic species with extensive gene body methylation is suggestive of a chromatin function. The genetic interaction of the HARE-HTH containing ASXL with the methyl cytosine hydroxylating Tet2 protein is suggestive of a role for the domain in discriminating sequences with DNA modifications such as hmC. Bacterial versions include fusions to diverse restriction endonucleases, and a DNA glycosylase where it may play a similar role in detecting modified DNA.

This family consists of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase, or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and it also includes HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase from E. coli strain W. FAA is the last enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, it hydrolyzes fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate which then join the citric acid cycle. Mutations in FAA cause type I tyrosinemia in humans this is an inherited disorder mainly affecting the liver leading to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal tubular damages and neurologic crises amongst other symptoms. The enzymatic defect causes the toxic accumulation of phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolites. The E. coli W enzyme HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase contains two copies of this domain and functions in fourth and fifth steps of the homoprotocatechuate pathway; here it decarboxylates OPET to HHDD and isomerises this to OHED. The final products of this pathway are pyruvic acid and succinic semialdehyde. This family also includes various hydratases and 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylases which are involved in the bacterial meta-cleavage pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds. 2-hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase encoded by mhpD in E. coli is involved in the phenylpropionic acid pathway of E. coli and catalyzes the conversion of 2-hydroxy pentadienoate to 4-hydroxy-2-keto-pentanoate and uses a Mn2+ co-factor.

Hence, cleavage of heparan sulfate (HS) affects the integrity and functional state of tissues and thereby fundamental normal and pathological phenomena involving cell migration and response to changes in the extracellular micro-environment. Heparanase degrades HS at specific intra-chain sites. The enzyme is synthesized as a latent approximately 65 kDa protein that is processed at the N-terminus into a highly active approximately 50 kDa form.

The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains.

This domain is found in two families of proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. These are the Piwi family and the Dicer family, that includes the Carpel factory protein. The function of the domains is unknown but has been suggested to mediate complex formation between proteins of the Piwi and Dicer families by hetero-dimerization. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains. PAZ can bind the characteristic two-base 3' overhangs of siRNAs, indicating that although PAZ may not be a primary nucleic acid binding site in Dicer or RISC, it may contribute to the specific and productive incorporation of siRNAs and miRNAs into the RNAi pathway."

Determination of the crystal structure of Argonaute reveals that PIWI is an RNase H domain, and identifies Argonaute as Slicer, the enzyme that cleaves mRNA in the RNAi RISC complex. In addition, Mg+2 dependence and production of 3'-OH and 5' phosphate products are shared characteristics of RNaseH and RISC. The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to the RNase H family of enzymes. RNase H fold proteins all have a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices.

This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription elongation Spt4 proteins as well as archaebacterial RpoE2. Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles. RpoE2 is one of 13 subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved in. The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of the transcription elongation machinery."

Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex.

The rat protein YT521-B is a tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear protein, that interacts with the nuclear transcriptosomal component scaffold attachment factor B, and the 68-kDa Src substrate associated during mitosis, Sam68.

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a large family of modular RNA-binding proteins which mediate several aspects of gene expression primarily in organelles but also in the nucleus. PPR_long is the region of Arabidopsis protein-only RNase P (PRORP) enzyme that consists of up to eleven alpha-helices. PRORPs are a class of RNA processing enzymes that catalyze maturation of the 5' end of precursor tRNAs in Eukaryotes. All PPR proteins contain tandemly repeated sequence motifs (the PPR motifs) which can vary in number. The series of helix-turn-helix motifs formed by PPR motifs throughout the protein produces a superheros with a central groove that allows the protein to bind RNA. Proteins containing PPR motifs are known to have roles in transcription, RNA processing, splicing, stability, editing, and translation. Over a decade after the discovery of PPR proteins, the super-helical structure was confirmed. The protein-only mitochondrial RNase P crystal structure from Arabidopsis thaliana (PRORP1) confirmed the role of its PPR motifs in pre-tRNA binding and suggest it has evolved independently from other RNase P proteins that rely on catalytic RNA."

The membrane-attack complex (MAC) of the complement system forms transmembrane channels. These channels disrupt the phospholipid bilayer of target cells, leading to cell lysis and death. A number of proteins participate in the assembly of the MAC. Freshly activated C5b binds to C6 to form a C5b-6 complex, then to C7 forming the C5b-7 complex. The C5b-7 complex binds to C8, which is composed of three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), thus forming the C5b-8 complex. C5b-8 subsequently binds to C9 and acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of C9. Active MAC has a subunit composition of C5b-C6-C7-C8-C9{n}. Perforin is a protein found in cytolytic T-cell and killer cells. In the presence of calcium, perforin polymerizes into transmembrane tubules and is capable of lysing, non-specifically, a variety of target cells. There are a number of regions of similarity in the sequences of complement components C6, C7, C8-alpha, C8-beta, C9 and perforin. The X-ray crystal structure of a MACPF domain reveals that it shares a common fold with bacterial cholesterol dependent cytolysins (pfam01289) such as perfringolysin O.

These proteins share a common set of 4 acidic conserved residues that are predicted to constitute their active site.

Mlo proteins are localized in the plasma membrane and possess seven transmembrane regions; thus the Mlo family is the only major higher plant family to possess 7 transmembrane domains.

The CLU domain (CLUstered mitochondria) is a eukaryotic domain found in proteins from fungi, protozoa, plants to humans. It is required for correct functioning of the mitochondria and mitochondrial transport although the exact function of the domain is unknown. In Dictyostelium the full-length protein is required for a very late step in fission of the outer mitochondrial membrane suggesting that mitochondria are transported along microtubules, as in mammalian cells, rather than along actin filaments, as in budding yeast. Disruption of the protein-impaired cytokinesis and caused mitochondria to cluster at the cell centre. It is likely that CLU functions in a novel pathway that positions mitochondria within the cell based on their physiological state.

The seven in absentia (sina) gene was first identified in Drosophila. The Drosophila Sina protein is essential for the determination of the R7 pathway in photoreceptor cell development: the loss of functional Sina results in the transformation of the R7 precursor cell to a non- neuronal cell type. The Sina protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain pfam00097. Through this domain, Sina binds E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UbcD1) Sina also interacts with Tramtrack (TTK88) via PHYL. Tramtrack is a transcriptional repressor that blocks photoreceptor determination, while PHYL down-regulates the activity of TTK88. In turn, the activity of PHYL requires the activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase, a process essential for R7 determination. It is thought that thus Sina targets TTK88 for degradation, therefore promoting the R7 pathway. Murine and human homologs of Sina have also been identified. The human homolog Siah-1 also binds E2 enzymes (UbcH5) and through a series of physical interactions, targets beta-catenin for ubiquitin degradation. Siah-1 expression is enhanced by p53, itself promoted by DNA damage. Thus this pathway links DNA damage to beta-catenin degradation. Sina proteins, therefore, physically interact with a variety of proteins. The N-terminal RING finger domain that binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes is described in pfam00097, and does not form part of the alignment for this family. The remainder C-terminal part is involved in interactions with other proteins, and is included in this alignment. In addition to the Drosophila protein and mammalian homologs, whose similarity was noted previously, this family also includes putative homologs from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana."

Raffinose synthase (EC:2.4.1.82) is the key enzyme that channels sucrose into the raffinose oligosaccharide pathway. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) are ubiquitous in plant seeds and are thought to play critical roles in the acquisition of tolerance to desiccation and seed longevity. Raffinose synthases are alkaline alpha-galactosidases and are solely responsible for RFO breakdown in germinating maize seeds, whereas acidic galactosidases appear to have other functions.

Thus wild-type Mlo proteins are thought to be inhibitors of cell death whose deficiency lowers the threshold required to trigger the cascade of events that result in plant cell death. Mlo proteins are localized in the plasma membrane and possess seven transmembrane regions; thus the Mlo family is the only major higher plant family to possess 7 transmembrane domains.

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen.

In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

There is a second region towards the C-terminus that has some features characteristic of a rrm but does not appear to have the important structural core of a rrm.

The 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP22) is a major component of peroxisomal membranes. PMP22 seems to be involved in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome membrane by specific targeting information. Mpv17 is a closely related peroxisomal protein. In mouse, the Mpv17 protein is involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis. More recently a homolog of Mpv17 in S. cerevisiae has been been found to be an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it has been proposed to have a role in ethanol metabolism and tolerance during heat-shock. Defects in MPV17 is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) and Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH). MDDS is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Primary mtDNA depletion is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and may affect single organs, typically muscle or liver, or multiple tissues. Individuals with the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome have early progressive liver failure and neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and increased lactate in body fluids. NNH is an autosomal recessive disease that is prevalent among Navajo children in the South Western states of America. The major clinical features are hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, corneal anesthesia and scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with intercurrent infections. Infantile, childhood, and classic forms of NNH have been described. Mitochondrial DNA depletion was detected in the livers of patients, suggesting a primary defect in mtDNA maintenance."

The two acireductone dioxygenase enzymes (ARD and ARD', previously known as E-2 and E-2') from Klebsiella pneumoniae share the same amino acid sequence, but bind different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD' binds Fe2+. ARD and ARD' can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion. The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalyzed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels.

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

DMP1 is a bone and teeth specific protein initially identified from mineralised dentin. DMP1 is primarily localized in the nuclear compartment of undifferentiated osteoblasts. In the nucleus, DMP1 acts as a transcriptional component for activation of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin. During the early phase of osteoblast maturation, Ca(2+) surges into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, triggering the phosphorylation of DMP1 by a nuclear isoform of casein kinase II. This phosphorylated DMP1 is then exported out into the extracellular matrix, where it regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite. DMP1 is a unique molecule that initiates osteoblast differentiation by transcription in the nucleus and orchestrates mineralised matrix formation extracellularly, at later stages of osteoblast maturation. The DMP1 gene has been found to be ectopically expressed in lung cancer although the reason for this is unknown."

In humans and most other metazoans, mt-RNase P is composed of three protein subunits (mitochondrial RNase P proteins 1-3; MRPP1-3), homologs to the Arabidopsis thaliana PRORP1-3. This domain corresponds to the metallonuclease domain of PRORPs. PRORP1 has 22% sequence identity to the human homolog MRPP3. PRORP1 crystal structure shows a V-shaped tripartite structure with a C-terminal metallonuclease domain of the NYN (N4BL1, YacP-like nuclease) family, with a typical and functional two-metal-ion catalytic site that has conserved aspartate residues."

PIG-S is one of several key, core, components of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) trans-amidase complex that mediates GPI anchoring in the endoplasmic reticulum. Anchoring occurs when a protein's C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide is replaced with a pre-assembled GPI. Mammalian GPITransamidase consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U, all five of which are required for function.

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber. The occurrence of Bet v 1-related proteins is confined to seed plants with the exception of a cytokinin-binding protein from the moss Physcomitrella patens."

Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K.

The Atg14 or Apg14 proteins are hydrophilic proteins with a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa, and have a coiled-coil motif at the N-terminus region. Yeast cells with mutant Atg14 are defective not only in autophagy but also in sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar-soluble hydrolase, to the vacuole. Subcellular fractionation indicate that Apg14p and Apg6p are peripherally associated with a membrane structure(s). Apg14p was co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p, suggesting that they form a stable protein complex. These results imply that Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions: in the autophagic process and in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. Apg14p may be a component specifically required for the function of Apg6/Vps30p through the autophagic pathway. There are 17 auto-phagosomal component proteins which are categorized into six functional units, one of which is the AS-PI3K complex (Vps30/Atg6 and Atg14). The AS-PI3K complex and the Atg2-Atg18 complex are essential for nucleation, and the specific function of the AS-PI3K apparently is to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). The localization of this complex at the PAS is controlled by Atg14. Autophagy mediates the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, protein aggregation, and pathogen invasion in humans, and malfunction of autophagy has been implicated in multiple human diseases including cancer.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K.

These complexes are transiently recruited from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membrane where they bind transmembrane proteins previously marked for degradation by mono-ubiquitination. Assembly of ESCRT-III, a complex composed of at least four subunits (Vps2, Vps24, Vps20, Snf7), is intimately linked with MVB vesicle formation, its disassembly being an essential step in the MVB vesicle formation, a reaction that is carried out by Vps4, an AAA-type ATPase. The family Ist1 is a regulator of Vps4 activity; by interacting with Did2 and Vps4, Ist1 appears to regulate the recruitment and oligomerization of Vps4.

The mutations led to stabilisation of two different substrates for this process. The mutant classes were called 'der' for 'degradation in the ER'. DER1 was cloned by complementation of the der1-2 mutation. The DER1 gene codes for a novel, hydrophobic protein, that is localized to the ER.

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

Programmed cell-death involves a set of Bcl-2 family proteins, some of which inhibit apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) and some of which promote it (Bax and Bak). Human Bax inhibitor, BI-1, is an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein containing multiple membrane-spanning segments predominantly localized to intracellular membranes. It has 6-7 membrane-spanning domains. The C termini of the mammalian BI-1 proteins are comprised of basic amino acids resembling some nuclear targeting sequences, but otherwise the predicted proteins lack motifs that suggest a function. As plant BI-1 appears to localize predominantly to the ER, we hypothesized that plant BI-1 could also regulate cell death triggered by ER stress. BI-1 appears to exert its effect through an interaction with calmodulin. The budding yeast member of this family has been found unexpectedly to encode a BH3 domain-containing protein (Ybh3p) that regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in a phylogenetically conserved manner. Examination of the crystal structure of a bacterial member of this family shows that these proteins mediate a calcium leak across the membrane that is pH-dependent. Calcium homoeostasis balances passive calcium leak with active calcium uptake. The structure exists in a pore-closed and pore-open conformation, at pHs of 8 and 6 respectively, and the pore can be opened by intracrystalline transition; together these findings suggest that pH controls the conformational transition."

Nup120 is conserved from fungi to plants to humans, and is homologous with the Nup160 of vertebrates. The nuclear core complex, or NPC, mediates macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope. Deletion of the NUP120 gene causes clustering of NPCs at one side of the nuclear envelope, moderate nucleolar fragmentation and slower cell growth. The vertebrate NPC is estimated to contain between 30 and 60 different proteins. most of which are not known. Two important ones in creating the nucleoporin basket are Nup98 and Nup153, and Nup120, in conjunction with Nup 133, interacts with these two and itself plays a role in mRNA export.

The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centers on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches. The larger branch 1 contains a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase. The latter is an unusual example of a mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members appear to be phosphatases. The bacterial regulatory protein phosphatase SixA is also in branch 1 and has a minimal, and possible ancestral-like structure, lacking the large domain insertions that contribute to binding of small molecules in branch 1 members."

The 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP22) is a major component of peroxisomal membranes. PMP22 seems to be involved in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome membrane by specific targeting information. Mpv17 is a closely related peroxisomal protein. In mouse, the Mpv17 protein is involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis. More recently a homolog of Mpv17 in S. cerevisiae has been been found to be an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it has been proposed to have a role in ethanol metabolism and tolerance during heat-shock. Defects in MPV17 is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) and Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH). MDDS is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Primary mtDNA depletion is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and may affect single organs, typically muscle or liver, or multiple tissues. Individuals with the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome have early progressive liver failure and neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and increased lactate in body fluids. NNH is an autosomal recessive disease that is prevalent among Navajo children in the South Western states of America. The major clinical features are hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, corneal anesthesia and scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with intercurrent infections. Infantile, childhood, and classic forms of NNH have been described. Mitochondrial DNA depletion was detected in the livers of patients, suggesting a primary defect in mtDNA maintenance."

Members of this family have been predicted to contain transmembrane helices. The family member LEM3 is a ligand-effect modulator, mutation of which increases glucocorticoid receptor activity in response to dexamethasone and also confers increased activity on other intracellular receptors including the progesterone, oestrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. LEM3 is thought to affect a downstream step in the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. Factors that modulate ligand responsiveness are likely to contribute to the context-specific actions of the glucocorticoid receptor in mammalian cells. The products of genes YNR048w, YNL323w, and YCR094w (CDC50) show redundancy of function and are involved in regulation of transcription via CDC39. CDC39 (also known as NOT1) is normally a negative regulator of transcription either by affecting the general RNA polymerase II machinery or by altering chromatin structure. One function of CDC39 is to block activation of the mating response pathway in the absence of pheromone, and mutation causes arrest in G1 by activation of the pathway. It may be that the cold-sensitive arrest in G1 noticed in CDC50 mutants may be due to inactivation of CDC39. The effects of LEM3 on glucocorticoid receptor activity may also be due to effects on transcription via CDC39."

Previously classified as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase, but it is now recognized that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes to their nitronate (anionic) forms. The enzymes from the fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Williopsis saturnus var. mrakii (formerly classified as Hansenula mrakii) contain non-covalently bound FMN as the cofactor. Active towards linear alkyl nitronates of lengths between 2 and 6 carbon atoms and, with lower activity, towards propyl-2-nitronate. The enzyme from N. crassa can also utilize neutral nitroalkanes, but with lower activity. One atom of oxygen is incorporated into the carbonyl group of the aldehyde product. The reaction appears to involve the formation of an enzyme-bound nitronate radical and an a-peroxynitroethane species, which then decomposes, either in the active site of the enzyme or after release, to acetaldehyde and nitrite."

Mutations in Nramp1 may genetically predispose an individual to susceptibility to diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis conversely this might however provide protection form rheumatoid arthritis. Nramp2 is a multiple divalent cation transporter for Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ amongst others it is expressed at high levels in the intestine; and is major transferrin-independent iron uptake system in mammals. The yeast proteins Smf1 and Smf2 may also transport divalent cations."

Members of this family are probably proteases (after a isoprenyl group is attached to the Cys residue in the C-terminal CAAX motif of a protein to attach it to the membrane, the AAX tripeptide being removed by one of the CAAX prenyl proteases). The family contains the CAAX prenyl protease. The proteins contain a highly conserved Glu-Glu motif at the amino end of the alignment. The alignment also contains two histidine residues that may be involved in zinc binding. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes where they are probably involved in self-immunity. Investigation of the bacteriocin-like loci in the Gram positive bacteria locus from Lactobacillus sakei 23K confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (sak23Kalphabeta) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (sak23Ki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Interestingly, the immunity genes from three similar systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of Sak23Ki - thus a new concept in self-immunity."

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex.

Disruption of the protein-impaired cytokinesis and caused mitochondria to cluster at the cell centre.

Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches. The larger branch 1 contains a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase. The latter is an unusual example of a mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members appear to be phosphatases.

This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localization, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex.

The function of the domains is unknown but has been suggested to mediate complex formation between proteins of the Piwi and Dicer families by hetero-dimerization. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains.

This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localization, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex.

This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localization, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

It has been speculated that in higher eukaryotic YTH-family members may be involved in similar mechanisms to suppress gene regulation during gametogenesis or general silencing. The rat protein YT521-B is a tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear protein, that interacts with the nuclear transcriptosomal component scaffold attachment factor B, and the 68-kDa Src substrate associated during mitosis, Sam68. In vivo splicing assays demonstrated that YT521-B modulates alternative splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner. The YTH domain has been identified as part of the PUA superfamily."

Proteins in the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) family are known as major players in gibberellin (GA) signaling, which regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. Mutation of the SCARECROW (SCR) gene results in a radial pattern defect, loss of a ground tissue layer, in the root. The PAT1 protein is involved in phytochrome A signal transduction. A sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis showed that the GRAS family emerged in bacteria and belongs to the Rossmann-fold, AdoMET (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase superfamily. All bacterial, and a subset of plant GRAS proteins, are predicted to be active and function as small-molecule methylases. Several plant GRAS proteins lack one or more AdoMet (SAM)-binding residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues. Although GRAS proteins are implicated to function as transcriptional factors, the above analysis suggests that they instead might either modify or bind small molecules."

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber. The occurrence of Bet v 1-related proteins is confined to seed plants with the exception of a cytokinin-binding protein from the moss Physcomitrella patens."

The precise molecular and cellular function of members of this family is still unknown. Yet, they are known to be involved in cellular differentiation events. The Ndr1 group was the first to be discovered. Their expression is repressed by the proto-oncogenes N-myc and c-myc, and in line with this observation, Ndr1 protein expression is down-regulated in neoplastic cells, and is reactivated when differentiation is induced by chemicals such as retinoic acid. Ndr2 and Ndr3 expression is not under the control of N-myc or c-myc. Ndr1 expression is also activated by several chemicals: tunicamycin and homocysteine induce Ndr1 in human umbilical endothelial cells; nickel induces Ndr1 in several cell types. Members of this family are found in wide variety of multicellular eukaryotes, including an Ndr1 type protein in Helianthus annuus (sunflower), known as Sf21.

The domain binds DNA by flipping out the methylated cytosine base from the DNA double helix.The conserved tyrosine and aspartate residues and a glycine rich patch are critical for recognition of the flipped out base. Mammalian UHRF1 that contains this domain plays an important role in maintenance of methylation at CpG dinucleotides by recruiting DNMT1 to hemimethylated sites associated with replication forks. The SAD/SRA domain has been combined with other domains involved in the ubiquitin pathway on multiple occasions and such proteins link recognition of DNA methylation to chromatin-protein ubiquitination. The domain is also found in species that lack DNA methylation, such as certain apicomplexans, suggestive of other DNA-binding modes or functions.

This family was thought originally to be involved in cell-adhesion, but the members are now known to be proteasome subunit Rpn13, a novel ubiquitin receptor. The 26S proteasome is a huge macromolecular protein-degradation machine consisting of a proteolytically active 20S core, in the form of four disc-like proteins, and one or two 19S regulatory particles. The regulatory particle(s) sit on the top and or bottom of the core, de-ubiquitinate the substrate peptides, unfold them and guide them into the narrow channel through the centre of the core. Rpn13 and its homologs dock onto the regulatory particle through the N-terminal region which binds Rpn2. The C-terminal part of the domain binds de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 and enhances its isopeptidase activity. Rpn13 binds ubiquitin via a conserved amino-terminal region called the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin, termed Pru, domain. The domain forms two contiguous anti-parallel beta-sheets with a configuration similar to the pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD) fold. Rpn13's ability to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously supports evidence of its role as a ubiquitin receptor. Finally, when complexed to di-ubiquitin, via the Pru, and Uch37 via the C-terminal part, it frees up the distal ubiquitin for de-ubiquitination by the Uch37."

Thus wild-type Mlo proteins are thought to be inhibitors of cell death whose deficiency lowers the threshold required to trigger the cascade of events that result in plant cell death. Mlo proteins are localized in the plasma membrane and possess seven transmembrane regions; thus the Mlo family is the only major higher plant family to possess 7 transmembrane domains.

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds. They are particularly well known for their role in the degradation of environmental toxins and mutagens. They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localization, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

Programmed cell-death involves a set of Bcl-2 family proteins, some of which inhibit apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) and some of which promote it (Bax and Bak). Human Bax inhibitor, BI-1, is an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein containing multiple membrane-spanning segments predominantly localized to intracellular membranes. It has 6-7 membrane-spanning domains. The C termini of the mammalian BI-1 proteins are comprised of basic amino acids resembling some nuclear targeting sequences, but otherwise the predicted proteins lack motifs that suggest a function. As plant BI-1 appears to localize predominantly to the ER, we hypothesized that plant BI-1 could also regulate cell death triggered by ER stress. BI-1 appears to exert its effect through an interaction with calmodulin. The budding yeast member of this family has been found unexpectedly to encode a BH3 domain-containing protein (Ybh3p) that regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in a phylogenetically conserved manner. Examination of the crystal structure of a bacterial member of this family shows that these proteins mediate a calcium leak across the membrane that is pH-dependent. Calcium homoeostasis balances passive calcium leak with active calcium uptake. The structure exists in a pore-closed and pore-open conformation, at pHs of 8 and 6 respectively, and the pore can be opened by intracrystalline transition; together these findings suggest that pH controls the conformational transition."

This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localization, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

The mutations led to stabilisation of two different substrates for this process. The mutant classes were called 'der' for 'degradation in the ER'. DER1 was cloned by complementation of the der1-2 mutation. The DER1 gene codes for a novel, hydrophobic protein, that is localized to the ER. Deletion of DER1 abolished degradation of the substrate proteins. The function of the Der1 protein seems to be specifically required for the degradation process associated with the ER.

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

This domain is found in retinal degeneration B proteins, as well as a family of probable phospholipases. It has been shown that this domain is found in a longer C terminal region that binds to PYK2 tyrosine kinase.

The seven in absentia (sina) gene was first identified in Drosophila. The Drosophila Sina protein is essential for the determination of the R7 pathway in photoreceptor cell development: the loss of functional Sina results in the transformation of the R7 precursor cell to a non- neuronal cell type. The Sina protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain pfam00097. Through this domain, Sina binds E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UbcD1) Sina also interacts with Tramtrack (TTK88) via PHYL. Tramtrack is a transcriptional repressor that blocks photoreceptor determination, while PHYL down-regulates the activity of TTK88. In turn, the activity of PHYL requires the activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase, a process essential for R7 determination. It is thought that thus Sina targets TTK88 for degradation, therefore promoting the R7 pathway. Murine and human homologs of Sina have also been identified. The human homolog Siah-1 also binds E2 enzymes (UbcH5) and through a series of physical interactions, targets beta-catenin for ubiquitin degradation. Siah-1 expression is enhanced by p53, itself promoted by DNA damage. Thus this pathway links DNA damage to beta-catenin degradation. Sina proteins, therefore, physically interact with a variety of proteins. The N-terminal RING finger domain that binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes is described in pfam00097, and does not form part of the alignment for this family. The remainder C-terminal part is involved in interactions with other proteins, and is included in this alignment. In addition to the Drosophila protein and mammalian homologs, whose similarity was noted previously, this family also includes putative homologs from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana."

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

The ordered regions of the yeast BLM10 or PA200 (human homolog), full-length protein encode 32 HEAT repeat (HR)-like modules, each comprising two helices joined by a turn, with adjacent repeats connected by a linker. Whereas a standard HEAT repeat is composed of ~50 residues, the BLM10 HEAT repeats are highly variable. The length of helices ranges from 8 to 35 residues, turns range from 2 to 87 residues, and linkers range from 1 to 88 residues, with the longest linker, between HR21 and HR22, containing additional secondary structures (two strands and three helices). BLM10_mid is the middle ordered region of the three in BLM10. BLM10 is found to surround the proteasome entry pore in the 1.2 MDa complex of proteasome and BLM10 to form a largely closed dome that is expected to restrict access of potential substrates. Thus Blm10 and PA200 are predominantly nuclear and stimulate the degradation of model peptides, although they do not appear to stimulate the degradation of proteins, recognize ubiquitin, or utilize ATP."

Nramp1 is an integral membrane protein expressed exclusively in cells of the immune system and is recruited to the membrane of a phagosome upon phagocytosis. By controlling divalent cation concentrations Nramp1 may regulate the interphagosomal replication of bacteria. Mutations in Nramp1 may genetically predispose an individual to susceptibility to diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis conversely this might however provide protection form rheumatoid arthritis. Nramp2 is a multiple divalent cation transporter for Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ amongst others it is expressed at high levels in the intestine; and is major transferrin-independent iron uptake system in mammals.

The Atg14 or Apg14 proteins are hydrophilic proteins with a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa, and have a coiled-coil motif at the N-terminus region. Yeast cells with mutant Atg14 are defective not only in autophagy but also in sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar-soluble hydrolase, to the vacuole. Subcellular fractionation indicate that Apg14p and Apg6p are peripherally associated with a membrane structure(s). Apg14p was co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p, suggesting that they form a stable protein complex. These results imply that Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions: in the autophagic process and in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. Apg14p may be a component specifically required for the function of Apg6/Vps30p through the autophagic pathway. There are 17 auto-phagosomal component proteins which are categorized into six functional units, one of which is the AS-PI3K complex (Vps30/Atg6 and Atg14). The AS-PI3K complex and the Atg2-Atg18 complex are essential for nucleation, and the specific function of the AS-PI3K apparently is to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). The localization of this complex at the PAS is controlled by Atg14. Autophagy mediates the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, protein aggregation, and pathogen invasion in humans, and malfunction of autophagy has been implicated in multiple human diseases including cancer. This effect seems to be mediated through direct interaction of the human Atg14 with Beclin 1 in the human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III complex."

ARD and ARD' can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion. The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalyzed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels.

The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to the RNase H family of enzymes. RNase H fold proteins all have a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices. By analogy to RNase H enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA guided by the DNA strand in an RNA/DNA hybrid, the PIWI domain can be inferred to cleave single-stranded RNA, for example mRNA, guided by double stranded siRNA."

This domain is found in two families of proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. These are the Piwi family and the Dicer family, that includes the Carpel factory protein. The function of the domains is unknown but has been suggested to mediate complex formation between proteins of the Piwi and Dicer families by hetero-dimerization. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains. PAZ can bind the characteristic two-base 3' overhangs of siRNAs, indicating that although PAZ may not be a primary nucleic acid binding site in Dicer or RISC, it may contribute to the specific and productive incorporation of siRNAs and miRNAs into the RNAi pathway."

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

Its diverse architectures in eukaryotic species with extensive gene body methylation is suggestive of a chromatin function. The genetic interaction of the HARE-HTH containing ASXL with the methyl cytosine hydroxylating Tet2 protein is suggestive of a role for the domain in discriminating sequences with DNA modifications such as hmC. Bacterial versions include fusions to diverse restriction endonucleases, and a DNA glycosylase where it may play a similar role in detecting modified DNA.

Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K.

Family members are membrane transporters since two members, cystinosin and PQLC2, transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. The 2nd PQ-loop of cystinosin hosts the substrate-coupled H+ binding site underlying its H+ symport mechanism, suggesting that PQ-loop repeats have functional significance.

Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches.The smaller branch 2 contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The catalytic functions in members include phytase, glucose-1-phosphatase and multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase.

The spliceosome, an assembly of snRNAs (U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) and proteins, catalyzes the excision of introns from pre-mRNAs in two successive trans-esterification reactions. Step 2 depends upon integral spliceosome constituents such as U5 snRNA and Prp8 and non-spliceosomal proteins Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22. ATP hydrolysis by the DEAH-box enzyme Prp16 promotes a conformational change in the spliceosome that leads to protection of the 3'ss from targeted RNase H cleavage. This change, which probably reflects binding of the 3'ss PyAG in the catalytic centre of the spliceosome, requires the ordered recruitment of Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 to the spliceosome. There is a close functional relationship between Prp8, Prp18, and Slu7, and Prp18 interacts with Slu7, so that together they recruit Prp22 to the spliceosome.

Nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) / LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) is located in the nuclei of neuronal cells during development, it is co-expressed with Isl1 in early motor neuron differentiation and has a suggested role in the Isl1 dependent development of motor neurons. It is suggested that these proteins act synergistically to enhance transcriptional efficiency by acting as co-factors for LIM homeodomain and Otx class transcription factors both of which have essential roles in development. The Drosophila protein Chip is required for segmentation and activity of a remote wing margin enhancer.

Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds.

They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures."

Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K.

This entry refers to the DHHC domain, found in DHHC proteins which are palmitoyltransferases. Palmitoylation or, more specifically S-acylation, plays important roles in the regulation of protein localization, stability, and activity. It is a post-translational protein modification that involves the attachment of palmitic acid to Cys residues through a thioester linkage. Protein acyltransferases (PATs), also known as palmitoyltransferases, catalyze this reaction by transferring the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-CoA to the thiol group of Cys residues. They are characterized by the presence of a 50-residue-long domain called the DHHC domain, which in most but not all cases is also cysteine-rich and gets its name from a highly conserved DHHC signature tetrapeptide (Asp-His-His-Cys). The Cys residue within the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein. Some proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein, Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein, Mammalian ZDHHC9, Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1, Yeast Erf2 protein, and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1."

Family of endo-beta-N-glucuronidase, or heparanase. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a key role in the self- assembly, insolubility and barrier properties of basement membranes and extracellular matrices. Hence, cleavage of heparan sulfate (HS) affects the integrity and functional state of tissues and thereby fundamental normal and pathological phenomena involving cell migration and response to changes in the extracellular micro-environment. Heparanase degrades HS at specific intra-chain sites. The enzyme is synthesized as a latent approximately 65 kDa protein that is processed at the N-terminus into a highly active approximately 50 kDa form. Experimental evidence suggests that heparanase may facilitate both tumor cell invasion and neovascularization, both critical steps in cancer progression.

This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of 15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to PR-10: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple, celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or abiotic stress. Hyp-1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family. Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones. - (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases are enzymes catalyzing the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine. -Major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber.

This family consists of several eukaryotic Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs). Several have been identified mostly in human and rat. Different OATPs vary in tissue distribution and substrate specificity. Since the numbering of different OATPs in particular species was based originally on the order of discovery, similarly numbered OATPs in humans and rats did not necessarily correspond in function, tissue distribution and substrate specificity (in spite of the name, some OATPs also transport organic cations and neutral molecules). Thus, Tamai et al. initiated the current scheme of using digits for rat OATPs and letters for human ones. Prostaglandin transporter (PGT) proteins are also considered to be OATP family members.

Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K.
