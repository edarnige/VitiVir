This RNA methyltransferase domain is found in a wide range of ssRNA viruses, including Hordei-, Tobra-, Tobamo-, Bromo-, Clostero- and Caliciviruses. This methyltransferase is involved in mRNA capping. Capping of mRNA enhances its stability. This usually occurs in the nucleus. Therefore, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm encode their own. This is a specific guanine-7-methyltransferase domain involved in viral mRNA cap0 synthesis. Specificity for guanine 7 position is shown by NMR in and in vivo role in cap synthesis. Based on secondary structure prediction, the basic fold is believed to be similar to the common AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold. A curious feature of this methyltransferase domain is that it together with flanking sequences seems to have guanylyltransferase activity coupled to the methyltransferase activity.

RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including various hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snRNPs. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases The C-terminal beta strand (4th strand) and final helix are hard to align and have been omitted in the SEED alignment The LA proteins have an N terminal rrm which is included in the seed. There is a second region towards the C-terminus that has some features characteristic of a rrm but does not appear to have the important structural core of a rrm. The LA proteins are one of the main autoantigens in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease."

Therefore, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm encode their own. This is a specific guanine-7-methyltransferase domain involved in viral mRNA cap0 synthesis. Specificity for guanine 7 position is shown by NMR in and in vivo role in cap synthesis. Based on secondary structure prediction, the basic fold is believed to be similar to the common AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold. A curious feature of this methyltransferase domain is that it together with flanking sequences seems to have guanylyltransferase activity coupled to the methyltransferase activity.

The Ig-PH fusion domain is at the C-terminus. This domain has the N-terminal Ig beta-sandwich fold consisting of two antiparallel beta-sheets built from strands beta1 and beta2 and strands beta3-beta6, respectively. The C-terminus of the fused domains adopts the PH fold, of seven beta-strands, beta7-beta13 and two alpha-helices, alpha1 and alpha2 arranged into a beta-barrel. The Ig and PH domains appear to be truly fused together into an integral structure which displays a few conserved patches on the surface, particularly of the PH part. The canonical phosphoinositide-binding pocket of the classic PH domain is degenerate in this fused one, and the charge on the pocket suggest that the Ig-PH domain contains a non-canonical binding site for inositol phosphates.

Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches. The larger branch 1 contains a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase. The latter is an unusual example of a mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members appear to be phosphatases.
